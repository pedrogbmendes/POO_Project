/**
 * Package that gives the methods and utilities to perform a simulation of a specific population.
 * 
 * In this specific implementation the population is a colony of ants, that can move around a map 
 * (nodes of a graph). Also the ants can drop pheromones in the edges to give a trail of an ant's path.
 * 
 * The graph used is implemented using and {@link GraphInterface} interface.
